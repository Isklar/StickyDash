StickyDash
==========

Configuration files for the Sticky Piston Network dashboard


About
---------
This dashboard is built using [dashing](http://dashing.io/) and utilises [JSONAPI](https://github.com/alecgorge/jsonapi) to retrieve various pieces of server information including Tps and player counts.
I wont go into detial on how the widgets work as the dashing wiki is the best place to get started. However if you are stuck with a certain aspect feel free to message me.

Installation
-------------

1. First install Dashing
This is incredibly easy and only requires installation of Ruby 1.9+ if you dont have it already.

2. Install JSONAPI or your servers
I found that using the same username and password for each JSONAPI configuration was the easiest, but you may wish to avoid this for security reasons. Creating a user with only the required permissions
needed for the widgets is a good idea as well.
